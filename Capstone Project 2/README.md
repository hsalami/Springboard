This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks of the second capstone project. In this project, we analyze the violations of Allegheny County restaurants. Using the data of inspection results combined with Yelp reviews, we build a predictive model for restaurants' violations. The work on this project is divided into multiple steps: data wrangling, data storytelling, and in-depth analyis using machine learning.
