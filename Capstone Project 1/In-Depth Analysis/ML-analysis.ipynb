    "After we have explored the data visually and statistically, we are now ready to build a predictive model from the features of crashes in order to predict the crash type: Injury or No Injury crash. In this report, we go over the steps done to build the predictive model. We address first the different encoding schemes we tried for categorical variables, we then train different models and compare their performance. Since we have imbalances in the data (around 78% for no Injury crashes and 22% for Injury crashes), we compute the performance of the trained models in terms of their precision, recall and F1 scores. Since the performance of the trained models can be affected by the imbalances in the data, we also consider undersampling for the No Injury crash type and train the models accordingly. We then choose the best model and compute its performance on the test set.  "

    "Before we start training the model, we convert the entries of the nominal categorical features into numerical entries. One of the basic encoding scheme is one-hot encoding, which replaces a categorical feature with a number of columns equal to the number of levels or categories within the considered feature. Each level is then mapped to a series of 0 and 1, where the corresponding column of the level takes 1 and the remaining columns take 0. One of the main drawback of this scheme is that it increases the number of features in the data. Another encoding scheme that can replace a given categorical feature with a less number of columns is binary encoding, where each level of a given categorical feature is mapped to a binary number. There are also other types of encoding that replace a categorical feature with only one column, where each level of the given feature is mapped to a number computed based on its frequency. Some other schemes embed the target variable in the computation. For instance, target encoding is an encoding scheme that replaces features with a combination of posterior probability of the target given particular categorical value and the prior probability of the target over all the training data. Leave-one-out is \"very similar to target encoding but excludes the current row’s target when calculating the mean target for a level One of these schemes\", which makes this scheme less prone to overfitting and response leakage. For reference, check [here](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/leaveoneout.html) and [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/all-about-categorical-variable-encoding-305f3361fd02) \n",

    "Note that we are not only returning the accuracy of the trained model, but also its precision, recall and F1-score. As we previously mentioned, the metric of accuracy won't be helpful because of the imbalances in the data, this is why we look at different metrics. Since we are interested in detecting the Injury crashes, the metric recall measures how well the model is able to detect the Injury crash (minority class) by computing the true positive rate, and the metric precision indicates how much of the returned 1 labels do actually belong to Injury crashes. F1 score is the harmonic mean between precision and recall, and it is the metric we are going to use in deciding on the final model.\n",

    "\n",
    "We noticed that with undersampling the accuracy and recall scores decreased in general for all models and types of encoding, but the precision and F1 scores got better. We noticed that most of the models performed better with the one-hot and leave-one-out encodings than with the binary encodings. We also noticed that most of the models have very similar performance. This might suggest that the data might not have enough information that can help us in detecting crashes with Injury.\n",
