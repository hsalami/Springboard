# README

This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks of the first capstone project. In this project, we analyze the data of Chicago crashes and build a predictive model for crash severity. The work on this project was divided into multiple steps: data wrangling, data storytelling, and in-depth analyis using machine learning.
