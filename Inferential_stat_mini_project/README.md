# README

This folder contains the Jupyter notebboks for the inferenential statistics mini-projects:
- frequentist_statistics_1a-Q6.25.ipynb: this mini-project has some hands-on practice with concepts like t- and z-tests and Central Limit Theorem, using simulated normal data;
- frequentist_statistics_1b-Q6.25.ipynb: this mini-project has additional practice on frequentist inference with real-world data from a hospital;
- Bootstrap_Inference_Q.ipynb: in this mini-project, booststrap method is used to analyze medical charge data;
- Bayesian-Inference-Q.ipynb: in this mini-project, Bayesian inference is used to analyze medical charge data.
